                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>As a passionate and driven aerospace engineering upperclassmen at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to cutting-edge aerospace projects. With hands-on experience in unmanned aerial systems, satellite design, and rocket launch systems, I’ve honed my abilities in propulsion, aerodynamics, and avionics through internships and international competitions.
                    I led technical teams in aerospace initiatives like high-altitude rockets and 3D-printed drones while mentoring the next generation of STEM talent. I’m also the founder of "Cosmological" – a platform for sharing and exploring science.

                    <p>I am studying aerospace engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Through my education, projects, work, research, and more I have been able to develop skills in various fields. I do my best to keep learning and make sure I can apply what I have learnt to real world applications.</p>

                    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
                    <p>My experience in industry and academia has allowed me to understand the pace and requirements of different types of environments. I have been able to successfully adapt and contribute positively to the organizations I have been a part of. While the roles I have taken on are primarily related to Aerospace Engineering & Computer Science, 
                        their foundation covers almost all forms of core engineering - systems, electrical, materials, mechanical, and chemical.

                    <p>I am a strong believer in the famous Oppenheimer quote, "theory will only take you so far". I enjoy attempting to push the boundaries of what can be done. From self-landing rockets, to indoor skydiving robots, I want to push myself to innovate and develop my skillset by applying what I learn to real engineering projects. I am looking forward to expanding this list by a lot.</p>
